Several versions all come from same source by Dave Conroy
Used by Linux Torvalds - claimed it was terrible but he still used it
Minimal Emacs
Called "mg" -- maintained by openbsd
Problems with endlessly extensible systems
Most of main commands
Good way of learning Emacs
Windows may only be split horizontally -- C-x 2 works
If a buffer name begins and ends with an asterisk, the buffer is considered throwaway
M-< beginning-of-buffer M-> end-of-buffer (C-<home>/<end>) don't work
https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1
Configuration file is not called dot emacs but dot mg ".mg"
~/.mg-TERM -- terminal-specific startup file
Can only be minimally customized since it is written completely in C
Keys can be rebound and some parameters can be changed in startup files.
No customize UI
Multi-byte character sets, such as UTF-8, are not supported
It is extremely fast
Good alternative to Vi, Ex, Nano for simple text editing
