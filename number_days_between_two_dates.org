Work out the number of days between two dates in Emacs

e.g. vaccine 2nd dose

*  M-x calendar (C-c c)

C-space

M-=

* orgmode

Work out how many days to my next vaccine

Most useful for dates separated by a long period

<1998-02-01 Sun>--<2021-08-02 Mon>

Put point somehwere on the dates and type: =C-c C-y=

OR

=C-u C-c Cy= to insert number of days, i.e. ~org-time-stamp-to-now~
