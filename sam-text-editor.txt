THE TEXT EDITOR SAM
+++++++++++++++++++
By Rob Pike
For plan9 documentation: 9p.io/plan9/
git clone https://github.com/9fans/plan9port plan9
Install with ./INSTALL
Add these to your profile environment:
PLAN9=/home/red/bin/plan9port export PLAN9
PATH=$PATH:$PLAN9/bin export PATH
I had first to open "rc" from my linux terminal
and then from there run:
9p ls font to see the list of fonts
I then tried font=/mnt/font/DejavuSansMono/14/font sam
This worked.
From there went back to my Linux term and ran:
alias sam='font=/mnt/font/GoMono/15/font sam'
Can run within a bitmap terminal and without a bitmap terminal: sam -d
Sam edits uninterpreted ASCII text.
Joins the styles of the UNIX text editor ed6,7 with that of interactive cut-and-paste editors by providing a comfortable mouse-driven interface to a program with a solid command language driven by regular expressions.
Influence by the editors jim and by mux.
An editor in two halves: command (sam window) and the editing interface with bitmap display.
Sam is a text editor for multiple files.
File names may be provided when it is invoked:
sam file1 file2 â€¦
