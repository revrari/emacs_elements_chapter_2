Consult – Key features and some tweaks
*Note*
I am using the default Consult Use-package example

<https://github.com/minad/consult#use-package-example>

*Important search/navigation commands*


1 consult-buffer
════════════════

  • Previews
  • Works with selectrum quick-keys
  • restrict list of choices with a prefix key: f,b,m
  • if you press DEL (Backspace) afterwards, the full candidate list
    will be shown again.
  • You can show virtual buffers. It is enabled by default if you have
    recentf-mode enabled.
  • It is possible to configure the list of sources via:

  `consult-buffer-sources'

  • To disable preview:

  `consult-preview-key' `nil'


2 consult-line
══════════════

  Search for a matching line and jump to the line beginning

  M-s l

  "Find this line"

  Supports live preview and recursive editing.


3 consult-outline
═════════════════

  Jump to the heading of the outline.
  Very helpful with org-files
  Supports live preview and recursive editing


4 consult-imenu (narrowing)
═══════════════════════════

  M-g i

  presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview and narrowing
  support

  e.g. to quickly access functions in you init.el


5 consult-grep/ripgrep
══════════════════════

  M-s g

  If consult-grep is invoked with prefix argument C-u M-s g, you can
  specify the directory manually. Otherwise the default-directory is
  searched.

  If you use Embark you can export the matches found by consult-grep,
  consult-ripgrep and consult-git-grep to a Grep buffer, where the
  matches across files can be edited, if the wgrep package is installed.


6 consult-yank-pop
══════════════════

  M-y

  Browse the kill ring

  *There are more "hidden gems"*
